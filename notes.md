Summary:
•	Data Pipeline:
• Implemented a data module that downloads CIFAR-10, applies standard augmentations (random crop, horizontal flip, normalization), and provides loaders for training, validation, and competition test data.
• Implication: Standard augmentation aids generalization but may be insufficient for robust performance.
	•	Model Architecture:
• Developed a ResNet-18 style model using basic residual blocks.
• Issue: The model’s parameter count (~11M) far exceeds the competition limit of 5M, potentially breaking competition rules.
• Impact: Requires architectural modifications (e.g., reducing channels, using bottleneck blocks, or depthwise separable convolutions) to meet the parameter constraint.
	•	Training Strategy:
• Utilized Adam optimizer (lr=0.001, weight decay=5e-4) with Cosine Annealing scheduler over 50 epochs and early stopping at ~88% accuracy on validation.
• Achieved 88.25% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and a competition test score of 0.75159.
• Note: While the training approach is solid, the high parameter count and basic augmentations may limit generalizability.
	•	Compliance & Reproducibility:
• The model is trained from scratch (complying with the rule against using pretrained weights) and employs standard CIFAR-10 data only.
• Concern: Exceeding the parameter limit not only violates competition rules but may also lead to overfitting, reducing performance on the custom test dataset.
