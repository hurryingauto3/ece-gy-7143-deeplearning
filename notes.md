Below is a comprehensive list of tweaks—from optimizer settings to scheduling—that you can try sequentially. I’ve ordered them from those likely to yield the highest performance boost to the smallest gains, along with detailed explanations:
	1.	Reduce Weight Decay
	•	What: Lower the weight decay value (e.g., from 0.5 to 5e-4).
	•	Why: Excessive decay forces weights too close to zero, leading to severe underfitting. Lowering it lets the model adjust weights more freely and capture useful features.
	2.	Tune the Base Learning Rate
	•	What: Experiment with the initial learning rate (try slight increases or decreases around 1e-3).
	•	Why: The learning rate controls how much weights are updated per step. An optimal rate ensures stable and efficient convergence.
	3.	Optimizer Selection & Hyperparameter Adjustment
	•	What:
	•	Switch between optimizers: For instance, compare Adam, AdamW, and SGD with momentum.
	•	Adjust optimizer-specific parameters:
	•	For SGD: tweak momentum (typically 0.9 or 0.99) and consider enabling Nesterov momentum.
	•	For Adam: check beta1 and beta2 (default are 0.9 and 0.999) and see if slight changes help.
	•	Why: Different optimizers and their settings can affect convergence speed and quality. AdamW, for instance, decouples weight decay from the gradient update, sometimes yielding better results.
	4.	Learning Rate Scheduling
	•	What:
	•	CosineAnnealingLR: Offers smooth decay over epochs.
	•	StepLR/ExponentialLR: Drops the learning rate by a set factor at specific epochs or continuously decays it.
	•	ReduceLROnPlateau: Lowers the rate when a monitored metric stops improving.
	•	Warmup Schedules: Gradually increase the learning rate at the start of training to stabilize initial updates.
	•	Cyclical Learning Rates: Oscillate the learning rate within a range to potentially escape local minima.
	•	Why: A well-tuned scheduler can improve convergence and final performance. Warmup, for example, avoids instability early on, while cosine annealing often leads to smoother fine-tuning later.
	5.	Batch Size & Gradient Accumulation
	•	What:
	•	Batch Size: Adjust the number of samples per batch (e.g., from 128 to 256 or vice versa).
	•	Gradient Accumulation: Accumulate gradients over multiple small batches if memory is limited.
	•	Why:
	•	Larger batches yield smoother gradient estimates, but may require scaling the learning rate.
	•	Smaller batches can improve generalization by introducing noise in the updates.
	•	Accumulation simulates a larger batch size without extra memory overhead.
	6.	Regularization Techniques Beyond Weight Decay
	•	Dropout:
	•	What: Introduce dropout layers (if not already present) or adjust their rates.
	•	Why: Helps prevent overfitting by randomly zeroing out activations during training.
	•	Batch Normalization Tweaks:
	•	What: Adjust the momentum parameter of BatchNorm layers.
	•	Why: Can affect how quickly the running statistics adapt to the data, impacting training stability.
	•	Label Smoothing:
	•	What: Use label smoothing in your loss function.
	•	Why: Reduces model overconfidence and improves generalization.
	7.	Data Augmentation Enhancements
	•	Basic Augmentations: Ensure you’re using random cropping and horizontal flipping.
	•	Advanced Augmentations:
	•	RandAugment: Randomly applies diverse augmentation policies.
	•	ColorJitter: Varies brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue.
	•	Random Erasing: Randomly occludes parts of the image to force robust feature extraction.
	•	Mixup/CutMix: Combines images and labels to create synthetic training samples.
	•	Why: Improved augmentation increases data diversity, which helps the model generalize better and can lead to significant performance gains.
	8.	Loss Function Tweaks
	•	What:
	•	Try standard cross-entropy loss vs. a version with label smoothing.
	•	Why: Label smoothing prevents the network from becoming too confident on training samples, which can improve test performance.
	9.	Additional Techniques
	•	Mixed Precision Training:
	•	What: Use FP16 (mixed precision) to reduce training time and memory usage.
	•	Why: It can also sometimes lead to a performance boost due to larger effective batch sizes or faster iteration cycles.
	•	Exponential Moving Average (EMA):
	•	What: Maintain an EMA of the model weights during training.
	•	Why: EMA can stabilize training and often produces a model with better generalization.
	•	Early Stopping:
	•	What: Monitor validation metrics and stop training once performance plateaus.
	•	Why: Prevents overfitting and saves training time.
	10.	Hyperparameter Optimization & Experiment Logging
	•	What:
	•	Use systematic methods like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to explore hyperparameters.
	•	Log experiments using tools like TensorBoard, Weights & Biases, or similar.
	•	Why: Keeping detailed logs and systematic searches can help you isolate the most effective changes and ensure reproducibility.

Each tweak targets a specific aspect of training—from stabilizing and accelerating convergence to boosting model capacity and generalization—so you can apply them sequentially and measure their individual impact on performance.
